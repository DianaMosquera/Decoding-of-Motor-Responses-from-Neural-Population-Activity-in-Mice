# Single-neuron-recording-Steinmetz
We will try to understand which areas of the brain are involved in the behavior of the mice during the experimental task of the Steinmetz dataset recorded using Neuropixel probes.    For this approach we will try to use a machine learning model to classify the different responses the mice made. Weâ€™ll use recordings from different brain regions as inputs to study the brain activity specific to different decision-making tasks in mice. And we will evaluate different time-window sizes of the recording to use as input of the model.  We will apply Dimensionality Reduction on the data of different brain regions, train a classification model of the rat's response and explain the impact of different brain regions activity using SHAP additive explanations.  Our analysis should help us understand dominant areas of the brain that are involved in the decision making process of the mice between the time zones stimulus onset and reaction time of the mice.  The experimental task involves visual stimuli followed by an auditory cue that signals the mouse's movement of the wheel. If the movement of the wheel is correct the mouse receives a reward.
